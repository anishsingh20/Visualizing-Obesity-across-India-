This project is all about how to collect data from a webpage and to analyze or visualize it in R.The data is scraped from Wikipedia which includes the Obesity report of India based on data from the 2007 National Family Health Survey.


Obesity in India has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st century, with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the country's population.India is following a trend of other developing countries that are steadily becoming more obese. Unhealthy, processed food has become much more accessible following India's continued integration in global food markets. This, combined with rising middle class incomes, is increasing the average caloric intake per individual among the middle class and above income households. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and other Health related diseases.
